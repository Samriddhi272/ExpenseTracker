# ExpenseTracker
It asks the user for expenses (food, rent, travel, etc.) and output a simple weekly/monthly  summary.
I have watched few youtube videos to get the idea on how it should look like and what kind of requirements i want my app to perform.
Step-1 I planned how i want to work on it and set up VsCode and MySql for database and then will work on it.
My vision for the app-
-User enters Expenses
-Save expenses to csv file
-Summarise Expense totals
-Show remaining budget according to month(if the expense is monthly)
-Depict graphs also for the expenses(if possible)

I have divided code according to my goals and into three functions mainly
-Getting expense details(categorising them and everything about it )
-Saving all the data to the file
-Displaying monthly budget ,total expense 
(Once i get donr with it , I will plan for how i want it to look on UI and what features do i want to keep in that)
All the functions are created and they run fine and are providing the required output.
For now- This app asks for expense name, amount spend and the category and then it saves the data provided into a file named"Expenses.csv" Then it keeps adding the all the expenses category wise and shows total amount spent.
I have also thought of adding date of the expense, so that we can easily track monthly /weekly expense.
I am facing a problem ,previously my data was being grouped according to category and then i added date feature so that monthly expenses can be displayed in datewise manner from particular date to a particular date and categorically.
